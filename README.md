<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Problem Statement: 
In the effort to explore, define, and understand the favorable grocery consumer, the research project question asks: what behavioral independent variables (day an order is placed, time of day an order is placed, and what items are ordered) best predict grocery consumer?

### Abstract:
Instacart shopping data can be analyzed to determine key shopper characteristics and related traits pertaining to food and non-food product consumer shopping traits and order histories. An exploratory data analysis confirms most Instacart orders occur between 0800 and 1600 (8 AM and 6 PM, respectively). Product reorders occurred on average at or around 8 days after the original order was placed. The analysis was extended to review non-food items. The analysis explores order characteristics and shopping patterns that may potentially identify ideal Instacart shopping consumer behaviors.

### Built With:
